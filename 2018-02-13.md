_Though I have to travel far..._

Editors are hard to use out-of-the-box? Actually, they are hard to use even with famous extensions. 
My whole 5 hours has gone to waste reading stupid docs about 'launch.json', fuck it! When it comes to run a script, just set up the runtime and click the green rectangle is not enough? You([VSCode]('https://code.visualstudio.com/')) must be joking.

What's even worse, your git GUI is useless. Command-Line is a better resolvement.

[JetBrains]('http://www.jetbrains.com/'), shut up and take my money.
