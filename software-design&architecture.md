## Week 1 - Introduction

### Book
JUST ENOUGH SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE - _A RISK DRIVEN APPROACH_

### Partitioning, knowledge, abstraction
Three parts of software architecture.

### Three examples of software architecture
1. Local log files: _only for developers_
2. Central database: _increase availability_
3. Indexing cluster: _increase performance_

### Reflections
- Quality attributes  
_promoting one quality inhibited another_
- Conceptual model  
- Constraints

### Perspective shift
- It is best to avoid GOTO statements and embrace structured programming.
- New architecture abstraction rarely replace old abstractions, but instead coexist(live together) with them.
- Effectively applying sofrware architecture ideas requires a conscious and explicit shift to embrace(accept?) its abstraction, such as components and connectors, rather than only using the abstractions found in mainstream programming.

### Architects architecting architectures
- The job role: _architect_
- The process: _architecting_
- The engineering artifact(man-made-objects): _the architecture_
